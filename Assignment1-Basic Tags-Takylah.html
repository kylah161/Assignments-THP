    In my free time I have various hobbies. I went to my first concert with my mom in the 11th grade it was a Fantasia concert. I love hanging out with my best friends Nijah, Ayden, Danyuna, and Caitlyn. I love traveling with my family to different places like Destin, Florida; Sevierville, Tennessee; and Panama City, Florida.
